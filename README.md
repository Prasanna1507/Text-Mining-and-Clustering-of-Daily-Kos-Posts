# Text-Mining-and-Clustering-of-Daily-Kos-Posts

Text Clustering

This project contains data related to the articles published on Daily Kos, an American political blog that publishes news and opinion articles written by progressive point of view. The file Dailykos contains data on 3,430 news articles or blogs that have been posted on Daily Kos. These articles were posted in 2004, leading up to the United States Presidential Election. Each of the variables in the dataset is a word that has appeared in at least 50 different articles (1,545 words in total). The set of words has been trimmed according to some of the techniques covered in the previous weeks (punctuation has been removed, and stop words have been removed). For each document, the variable values are the number of times that a word appeared in the document.
